# QuantumChoice
Webpage with several options for producing quantum randomness:
 
* Random number in a range
* Choose an item from a list
* 8-ball

## About
Powered by [qrng.js](https://github.com/shitchell/qrng), a javascript library that makes use of Australia National University's quantum random number generator.

*Fun fact: qrng.js is used to replace `Math.random()`, so everything on the page--even the movement of the particles in the background--is **quantum** random :D*

## Determinism
If you knock over the first domino in a line of dominoes, you know exactly what will happen next: the first domino will knock over the second domino, which in turn knocks down the third domino, and on. This is because we live in a universe that seems to have stringent, *predictable* physical laws. When you add `1 + 1`, you *always* get `2`. The velocity of an object will *always* be `distance / time`. Math doesn't change. So when you knock over the first domino, the chain reaction that follows is  calculatable. If you could perfectly measure the dimensions/mass of all the dominoes, the velocity of the first you knocked over, the graviational pull of not just the earth but even your own body--literally every factor involved... you could perfectly determine *exactly* how that chain reaction would play out before it even happens. You could say that the chain reaction that follows after knocking over the first domino isn't just predictable, it's *inevitable* due to the unchanging nature of math and physics.

So when that apple fell on Newton's head, it wasn't random. It was the inevitable result of millions of "dominoes" falling over before it: the tree's seed being planted, the tree growing over time, weather weakening the apple's stem from wind/rain, etc... The millions and billions of physical interactions involved make it so complex that we call it "random", but at the core it's still just dominoes falling over in a perfectly calculatable way. And again, if we had enough data and a powerful enough computer, we could have calculated *exactly* when that apple would fall off the tree and hit Newton in the head long before it ever happened.

This is *determinism*. It's the idea that every thing that happens is the inevitable consequence of all the other things that have happened. That if we had enough data, we could calculate every single event that will happen throughout the rest of humanity's existence. And a lot of people have mixed feelings about this. We like to believe our fate is in our hands, not the inevitable result of math and physical laws. There *might* be such a thing as free will... until we have a clearer understanding of consciousness, it's hard to say whether or not all of our actions are simply the inevitable result of neurons firing in our brain in a perfectly calculatable way.

**Thanks for the dissertation, what does this have to do with quantum?**

I'm so glad you asked! We've got a long ways to go before we have a good understanding of quantum mechanics, but one thing we've found is that it seems to operate based on *probability*. If you knock one quantum particle into another, all of a sudden the outcome is **not** perfectly predictable. Instead, you might have a 50% chance of Outcome A, a 30% chance of Outcome B, and a 20% chance of Outcome C. And whichever one ends up happening happens *completely randomly*. How is this possible in a universe based on math and stringent physical laws? WE HAVE NO IDEA. Quantum mechanics is one of our hugest modern mysteries. Einstein didn't agree with/like the random aspect of quantum mechanics, famously declaring that "God does not throw dice." Stephen Hawking countered that saying "not only does God play dice, but... he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen"

So if you flip a coin to make a decision, the outcome is not actually random. Whether it's heads or tails is the inevitable result of millions of factors. We simply call it "random" because *we* aren't smart enough to calculate what the result will be. Consequently, the "random" decision you thought you were making isn't random at all. It is *inevitable*.

But if you base a decision off of quantum randomness... oh boy. *Now* you're making a decision that can't be predicted by math and physical laws. *Now* your decision isn't simply some inevitable result of fate.

So introduce some quantum randomness into your life and write a new script--yours. Break free from determinism :)
